        <p>
            I enjoyed learning about express and routing. <br />
            I found it interesting to use React hooks to maniplute the app state. <br />
            Styling the app to be completly responsive was a bit hard. <br />

        <h2>What would happen if multiple users would use your calculator?</h2>
        <p>
            The app simply won't work. <br />
            A user will get some value of value, meanwhile other users will change the value, <br />
            and when that user will try to change the value he's corrently seeing he will get a  <br />
            completly different result than the one expected. (changed value +/-/x digit)<br />
